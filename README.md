# Online Demo - Molecule Symmetry Perception and Canonical SMILES

This is an [onlnie demo](https://n92in.sse.codesandbox.io/) to show the methods of Symmetry Perception and Canonical SMILES. Details can be found from the paper "A Computationally-Realizable Rigorous Canonical Numbering Algorithm for Chemical Graphs with its Open-Source Implementation in Rust". Welcome to check [our site](https://chiral-data.github.io/)

## Dependencies
- Rust crate [graph-symmetry](https://github.com/chiral-data/rust-graph-symmetry): codes of the methods from the paper.
- WASM binding of Crate graph-symmetry [graph_symmetry_wasm_binding](https://github.com/chiral-data/rust-graph-symmetry-webassembly) for Javascript.
- This demo built based on robinwieruch's [React with Webpack Tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/).
